# Build and install the J-SONIC plugins

[Back to the plugin overview](../README.md). Run all commands from the repository root.

## Get the source and build scripts

This repository includes the JUCE framework and seven independent plug-in
projects: [`projects/YinyangCompressor`](../projects/YinyangCompressor),
[`projects/ShunDeEsser`](../projects/ShunDeEsser),
[`projects/KuoStereo`](../projects/KuoStereo),
[`projects/ZaoDrive`](../projects/ZaoDrive),
[`projects/RenTransformer`](../projects/RenTransformer), [`projects/KuoVelvet`](../projects/KuoVelvet), and
[`projects/XuanPhase`](../projects/XuanPhase). Zao Drive models a common-emitter BJT
amplifier with adjustable bias, a Schottky op-amp feedback clipper, a diode shunt
clipper, and series-diode crossover distortion with adjustable driver impedance,
plus an expected-output display
and Yinyang's optional transformer stage.
[`Ren Transformer`](../projects/RenTransformer/README.md) isolates Yinyang's transformer
and output controls, and [`Kuo Velvet`](../projects/KuoVelvet/README.md) isolates
Kuo Stereo's Velvet widening with spectral transient protection in a compact UI.
All seven projects share an analog visual style while keeping independent processors and
build targets. You do not need another JUCE download. All build commands below
run from the repository root.

Build Shun De-Esser, Kuo Stereo, and Zao Drive with CMake using their
[SHUN](../projects/ShunDeEsser/README.md), [Kuo](../projects/KuoStereo/README.md), and
[Zao](../projects/ZaoDrive/README.md)
instructions. The `build-macos-all.sh` script builds all seven projects as
VST3 and AU; the individual platform scripts build Yinyang Compressor. The Windows
GitHub workflows provide a manual build of all seven plugins and the existing
automatic Yinyang Compressor and Shun De-Esser builds.

Download the main development branch with Git:

```bash
git clone --branch academic https://github.com/javelinmaxx/Multi-Compressor.git
cd Multi-Compressor
```

Build requirements common to all platforms: **CMake 3.22 or newer**, Git, and
an appropriate C++17 compiler. The commands below build Release plug-ins and
disable the test targets. Each platform needs its own binary; a macOS VST3
cannot load on Windows.

Build scripts are included at the repository root:

| Script | Builds |
| --- | --- |
| [`build-windows-vst3.ps1`](../build-windows-vst3.ps1) | Yinyang Windows x64 VST3 |
| [`build-macos.sh`](../build-macos.sh) | Yinyang macOS VST3, AU, or both; Apple Silicon, Intel, or universal |
| [`build-macos-all.sh`](../build-macos-all.sh) | All plugin projects as macOS VST3 and AU; Apple Silicon, Intel, or universal |

The scripts locate projects relative to their own location, stop if a build
fails, and print the finished bundle paths. They do not run test suites. Build
directories are excluded from Git.

## Windows VST3

### Build on Windows

Install **Visual Studio 2022** with the **Desktop development with C++** workload,
including the MSVC compiler, Windows SDK, and CMake tools. Open **Developer
PowerShell for VS 2022**, navigate to the repository root, and run:

```powershell
.\build-windows-vst3.ps1
```

Use `-Parallel 8` to change the job count. If your PowerShell policy blocks the
script, you can allow it for this invocation only:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build-windows-vst3.ps1
```

The equivalent direct CMake commands are:

```powershell
cmake -S projects/YinyangCompressor -B build-yinyang-win -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DYINYANG_COMPRESSOR_BUILD_TESTS=OFF '-DCMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY=MultiThreaded$<$<CONFIG:Debug>:Debug>'

cmake --build build-yinyang-win --config Release --target YinyangCompressor_VST3 --parallel 4
```

The complete Windows x64 plug-in bundle is:

```text
build-yinyang-win\YinyangCompressor_artefacts\Release\VST3\Yinyang Compressor.vst3
```

Copy the entire `.vst3` folder, including its contents, into:

```text
C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\
```

Windows may request administrator permission. Restart your Windows DAW and
rescan its plug-ins. The build links the MSVC runtime statically.

### Build with GitHub Actions

To build **all seven plugins, including APRiCOT**, open
[All Plugins - Windows VST3](https://github.com/javelinmaxx/Multi-Compressor/actions/workflows/all-plugins-windows.yml)
in Actions and select **Run workflow** on `master`. This workflow runs only
when manually requested; pushes and pull requests do not start it. Each plugin
builds in its own Windows x64 Release job with Visual Studio 2022, tests disabled,
and the MSVC runtime linked statically. Under **Artifacts**, download the seven
`<project>-Windows-x64-VST3` ZIPs and install the complete `.vst3` folders in
`C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\`. Artifacts are retained for 30 days.

The existing two-plugin workflow also remains available:

A Windows computer is not required to compile either plug-in. GitHub builds
Yinyang Compressor and Shun De-Esser in separate Windows jobs:

1. Open [Windows VST3 builds](https://github.com/javelinmaxx/Multi-Compressor/actions/workflows/yinyang-shun-windows.yml).
2. Enable Actions if GitHub prompts you, then open a successful run for the branch.
3. Under **Artifacts**, download **YinyangCompressor-Windows-x64-VST3** and
   **ShunDeEsser-Windows-x64-VST3**.
4. Extract each ZIP. Install both complete `.vst3` folders in the Windows
   plug-in location above.

Source/configuration pushes to `feature/character-compressor` or `master`
automatically trigger the workflow. Once the workflow is on the repository's
default branch, **Run workflow** also lets you start a build manually. You can
rerun an existing run using **Re-run all jobs**. Artifacts are retained for
30 days. Testing the resulting plug-in still requires a Windows host.

## macOS VST3

Install **Xcode** and open it once to finish setup and accept its licence.
Install **CMake 3.22 or newer** compatible with your macOS version. Ensure
`cmake` is available in Terminal. If needed, select your Xcode installation:

```bash
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

To build **all seven plugins as both VST3 and AU**, run:

```bash
./build-macos-all.sh
```

It defaults to the current shell architecture. For universal Apple Silicon and
Intel bundles, use `./build-macos-all.sh --arch universal --parallel 4`.
Projects build sequentially, with four jobs per project by default. The script
discovers JUCE plugin declarations under `projects/*/CMakeLists.txt`, disables
project test targets, and prints the finished bundles. Output is under
`build/macos-all/<architecture>/<project>/<target>_artefacts/Release/`, in the
`VST3` and `AU` subfolders. Bundle names come from the project, including
`Yinyang Compressor.vst3` and `Yinyang Compressor.component`.

Add `--install` to copy all successful builds into your user VST3 and Components
folders. Use `--build-root PATH` for another output location or `--help` for all
options. No plug-ins are installed by default.

The following commands build **Yinyang only**.

For an **Apple Silicon Mac**, run from the repository root:

```bash
./build-macos.sh vst3 --arch arm64 --install
```

This builds and installs the VST3 in your user plug-in folder. Omit `--install`
to build without copying it. Use `--arch x86_64` for Intel or `--arch universal`
for both architectures. Run `./build-macos.sh --help` for all options.

To build manually instead:

```bash
cmake -S projects/YinyangCompressor -B build-yinyang-mac-arm64 -G Xcode \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64 \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0 \
  -DYINYANG_COMPRESSOR_BUILD_TESTS=OFF

cmake --build build-yinyang-mac-arm64 --config Release \
  --target YinyangCompressor_VST3 --parallel 4
```

Install the complete bundle into your user plug-in folder:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3"
ditto \
  "build-yinyang-mac-arm64/YinyangCompressor_artefacts/Release/VST3/Yinyang Compressor.vst3" \
  "$HOME/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/Yinyang Compressor.vst3"
```

Restart your VST3 host or rescan its plug-ins. For DawDreamer, provide the
absolute path to the `.vst3` bundle and use Python with the same architecture
as the plug-in. Logic Pro uses the AU version described below.

**Intel Mac:** substitute `x86_64` for `arm64`, use a separate directory such as
`build-yinyang-mac-intel`, and update the build/install paths accordingly.
For a Catalina target, set `CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.15`; building directly
on Catalina requires a compatible toolchain (JUCE documents Xcode 12.4 and
macOS 10.15.4 as minimum build requirements). Verify on the target Mac.

**Universal build:** with a compatible Xcode SDK, set
`-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="arm64;x86_64"`, keep the deployment target at `11.0`,
and use a separate build directory. This produces a bundle for both architectures
on macOS 11 or later. Do not reuse an Intel build directory for an arm64 build.

## macOS AU

Use the same Xcode and CMake requirements as the macOS VST3 build. For an
**Apple Silicon Mac**, run from the repository root:

```bash
./build-macos.sh au --arch arm64 --install
```

To build and install **both AU and VST3** together, use:

```bash
./build-macos.sh all --arch arm64 --install
```

To build the AU manually instead:

```bash
cmake -S projects/YinyangCompressor -B build-yinyang-mac-arm64 -G Xcode \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64 \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0 \
  -DYINYANG_COMPRESSOR_BUILD_TESTS=OFF

cmake --build build-yinyang-mac-arm64 --config Release \
  --target YinyangCompressor_AU --parallel 4
```

Install the complete `.component` bundle:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components"
ditto \
  "build-yinyang-mac-arm64/YinyangCompressor_artefacts/Release/AU/Yinyang Compressor.component" \
  "$HOME/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/Yinyang Compressor.component"
```

The Intel and universal architecture substitutions from the macOS VST3 section
apply here as well. AU and VST3 can share a build directory when their
architecture and deployment settings match.

Restart Logic Pro and check **Plug-in Manager**. On an audio track, select
**Audio FX → Audio Units → J-SONIC → Yinyang Compressor**.
To run Apple's AU validator separately:

```bash
auval -v aufx Chc1 Chra
```


## Other projects and Linux builds

Every project has its own `CMakeLists.txt`. Substitute its directory, target,
and test option below when following a single-project example:

| Project directory | VST3 target | Test option |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `projects/YinyangCompressor` | `YinyangCompressor_VST3` | `YINYANG_COMPRESSOR_BUILD_TESTS` |
| `projects/ShunDeEsser` | `ShunDeEsser_VST3` | `SHUN_DE_ESSER_BUILD_TESTS` |
| `projects/KuoStereo` | `KuoStereo_VST3` | `KUO_STEREO_BUILD_TESTS` |
| `projects/ZaoDrive` | `ZaoDrive_VST3` | `ZAO_DRIVE_BUILD_TESTS` |
| `projects/RenTransformer` | `RenTransformer_VST3` | `REN_TRANSFORMER_BUILD_TESTS` |
| `projects/KuoVelvet` | `KuoVelvet_VST3` | `KUO_VELVET_BUILD_TESTS` |
| `projects/XuanPhase` | `XuanPhase_VST3` | `XUAN_PHASE_BUILD_TESTS` |

Replace `_VST3` with `_Standalone` for the standalone application, or `_AU`
for an Audio Unit on macOS. AU targets are available only on macOS.

Linux builds need a C++17 compiler, CMake 3.22+, and the system libraries listed
in [JUCE Linux dependencies](Linux%20Dependencies.md). The plugin projects disable
JUCE's web browser and curl features. For example, build a native Linux VST3:

```bash
cmake -S projects/ZaoDrive -B build/zao -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DZAO_DRIVE_BUILD_TESTS=OFF
cmake --build build/zao --config Release --target ZaoDrive_VST3 --parallel 4
```

Install the complete bundle from `build/zao/ZaoDrive_artefacts/Release/VST3/`
into `~/.vst3/`, then rescan the plugins in a Linux host. A Linux binary needs
a Linux host; use the corresponding platform toolchain for macOS or Windows.

For processor tests, configure the project's test option to `ON`, build its
specified test targets, and run:

```bash
ctest --test-dir <build-directory> -C Release --output-on-failure
```

Each project's README lists its test target names and any display requirements
for editor checks. Build scripts and the Windows packaging workflow deliberately
disable these test targets.
