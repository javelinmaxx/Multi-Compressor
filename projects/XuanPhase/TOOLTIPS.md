| Low Phase | Rotates frequencies below the crossover relative to the fixed 50 ms compensated reference, with no cap on the combined phase correction. |
| Crossover | Sets the smooth transition between the low and high manual phase controls. |
| High Phase | Rotates frequencies above the crossover relative to the fixed 50 ms compensated reference, with no cap on the combined phase correction. |
| Auto | Saves CPU when Off; uses lookahead and transient spectrogram phases to align narrow frequency bands. |
| Auto Depth | Sets automatic phase correction from reverse alignment at negative values to full alignment at positive values. |
| Transient | Sets how quickly automatic phase correction releases after a transient, with longer times retaining it longer. |
| Stereo Link | Links automatic correction at +100%, processes channels independently at 0%, and separates their transients toward -100%. |
| Bypass | Bypasses phase processing while preserving the fixed 50 ms latency. |
| Phase Field | Shows three seconds of input transients moving left to right, with early bands green, late bands red, and applied left phase in white and right phase in gold on a plus or minus 180 degree scale while correction targets remain uncapped. |
